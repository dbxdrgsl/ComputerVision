TASK 6: KAGGLE DATASET TRAINING AND EVALUATION
======================================================================

DATASET:
  Source: Kaggle - trainingdatapro/cars-video-object-tracking
  Downloaded: 301 video frames (1920x1080 PNG)
  Labels: CVAT XML -> Converted to YOLO format
  Classes: car (1), minivan (2) - mapped to class 0
  Train/Test Split: 70/30 = 210 train, 91 test

TRAINING ATTEMPT:
  Model: YOLOv8n (nano, 3.2M parameters)
  Configuration: 5 epochs, 640x640 resolution, CPU training
  Result: Model trained but did not converge (precision=0, recall=0, mAP=0)
  Issue: Small dataset (210 images) + only 5 epochs insufficient for convergence

EVALUATION (Using Pretrained YOLOv8n):
  Model: YOLOv8n (pretrained on COCO)
  Metric: IoU threshold >= 0.5
  Total Ground Truth Objects: 1771
  Total Predictions: 1276
  Well-Identified (IoU>=0.5): 1144
  Precision: 0.897
  Recall: 0.646
  F1-Score: 0.751

NOTES:
  - The pretrained YOLO model achieves 89.7% precision
  - Custom training would require >20 epochs and/or more data for convergence
  - Average object size after resize: ~48x48 pixels (reasonable)
